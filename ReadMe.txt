ROT-13
=======
"ROT-13" is an algorithm that uses a cipher. A cipher is a tool which translates one piece of data to another. If you’ve ever used a "decoder ring", that’s a cipher. The cipher has an input and an output.
There are many algorithms used in cryptography. One of the easiest goes back to the days of Ancient Rome.


Let’s make a cipher for "ROT-13":

Take a piece of lined paper
In a column, write the letters A through Z in order down the left side.
On the first line, start a second column by writing the letter N next to your A
Continue down the alphabet, so you now write "O" to the right of "B"
When your second column gets to "Z", start over again with "A"
The left side of your cipher is the input, the right side is the output.
Julius Caesar needed to send written instructions from his base in Rome to his soldiers thousands of miles away. What if the messenger was captured or killed? The enemy could read his plans!

Caesar’s army used an algorithm called "ROT-13".
